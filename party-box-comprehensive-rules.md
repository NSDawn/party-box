# 0 Extensions to Magic: The Gathering
## 0.0 General

- 0.0.0 All rules listed here are deviations from and clarifications of the comprehensive rules of Magic as they apply to multiplayer games. Where unspecified herein, refer to those rules.
	- 0.1.0a The rules herein are incomplete by nature, and focus on interactions and characteristics of cards currently within the cube. Further amendments are always possible
- 0.0.1 Nishant's Party Box (henceforth, 'NPB') is a silly format. No rule of NPB is truly set in stone, and no interaction in NPB is truly unambiguous.
	- 0.0.1b Player discretion will be oft noted herein, which defers to the attitude, play style, hopes and dreams of players, as long as the players reach accord. Even when not stated, player discretion may override any rule written herein or on card text.
- 0.0.2 Party Box is a shared-deck ('cube', 'box') format. Cards are provided by the party box owner. 
- 0.0.3 Players start the game with 20 life. Other starting life totals may be played, upon player discretion.
- 0.0.4 Players draw five cards as their starting hand. Players may not mulligan. 
	- 0.1.4a Reasonable levels of commiseration regarding card quality of one's opening hand is permissible. However, players deemed to be complaining too much by other players may be ejected. 

## 0.1 Shared zones

- 0.1.0 NPB features two libraries, one of assorted cards, but mostly spells (henceforth, the 'spell library') and one of lands (henceforth, 'the land library'). Both libraries start the game shuffled. However, neither deck can be shuffled during the game. 
- 0.1.1 When drawing, milling, revealing, scrying, surveilling, or performing any other card-neutral or card-positive action on a library, the active player chooses which library to affect. 
- 0.1.2 If a player would search a library for an unspecified card, they use the top card of a library instead. 
	- 0.2.2a If a player would search a library for a specified nonland card, they instead reveal the top cards of the spell library until they reveal a card of the specified characteristic, using that instead, exiling the other cards. 
	- 0.2.2b If a player would search a library for a land of any characteristic, they use the top card of the land library instead (even if it doesn't match the characteristic specified). 
    - 0.2.2c Upon player discretion, players may produce a card from outside the game instead. 
    - 0.2.2d Any other attempts to search a library fail. 
- 0.1.3 When putting a card into a library a finite number of cards from the top of a library, the card is put into the corresponding land or spell deck based on the card's identity. 
	- 0.2.4a If a card would be put a finite number of cards from the bottom of a library, exile the card instead. 
	- 0.2.3b If a card would be shuffled into a library, it is exiled instead. Then, cut the library into which it would have been shuffled. 
- 0.1.4 Static effects referring to a library, such as 'playing with the top card of your library revealed' refer to both shared libraries.
- 0.1.5 All effects referring to a graveyard refers to the shared graveyard. 
- 0.1.6 All cards that would be put into a graveyard are put into the shared graveyard. Any player may use the relevant activated abilities of cards in the graveyard. 
## 0.2 Specific rules 

- 0.2.0 During each of each player's main phases, in lieu of playing a land from their hand normally, they may reveal the top card of the land library. If they do, they must play it. This is called a 'Land Action'. For other intents and purposes, this still counts as playing that land from hand.
	- 0.3.0a If a player intends to take this action, but there are no cards in the land library with which to draw, they may produce a Wastes basic land card from their collection and use that instead. 
	- 0.3.0b If an effect allows a player to play any number of 'additional lands', they may take this many Land Actions instead.
	- 0.3.0c If an effect directs a player to play a land from their hand, they may take a Land Action instead.
# 2 Cards not originating from Magic: The Gathering
## 2.0 General

- 2.0.0 Each non-Magic: The Gathering card, (henceforth, a Beyond Universes Beyond card, 'BUB') is considered similarly to a Magic card with unofficial text, as would a foreign-language or a card subject to an errata. As such, each card has official oracle text in Section 4. Section 2 will list the methods by which the oracle text in Section 4 was decided upon.
- 2.0.1 BUB cards adhere to the norms and game design logic of their source game as much as possible, while not adding their mechanics to Magic: The Gathering. 
- 2.0.2 BUB cards without a clear written casting cost can be cast for 2 generic mana, unless specified by further rulings.
	- 2.0.2a Mana and mana-adjacent resources from other games can be paid in generic mana if no color is indicated.
	- 2.0.2b If a color is indicated, and if such color is differentiated in the source game, upon player discretion, the closest color in Magic's five color system must be used.
- 2.0.3 BUB Card types are based on the timing rules and restrictions of playing the card in the source game. In general, defer to mechanical similarity to Magic mechanics, rather than aesthetic similarity. (For example, Pokémon, YuGiOh monsters, and Lorcana characters are all creatures.)
	- 2.0.3a Card supertypes and subtypes defer to player discretion.
	- 2.0.4a Cards are nonlegendary by default. Upon player discretion, cards considered 'legendary' or one of a kind in their source material may be considered legendary.

	- 2.1.1e Pokémon's attacks are considered activated abilities that can deal the listed damage to any target, paying the energy cost as their activation cost in colored mana, as well as tapping the creature. Any listed effects of the attack also resolve. These activated abilities can only be activated during your declare attackers step. 
	- 2.1.1f Pokémon have a keyword ability called 'Damage counters' which causes them to take damage in the form of -1/-1 counters.

	- 2.1.1h Pokémon have an activated keyword ability called Retreat equal to their colorless energy retreat cost in colorless mana. Retreat {X} means a creature's controller can pay {X} in order to return that creature to their hand. Activate only as a sorcery. 

## 2.2 YuGiOh!

- 2.2.1 YuGiOh Trap cards are considered colorless enchantment artifact spells with a Set keyword ability which requires them to be cast face down as a colorless Trap artifact.

	- 2.2.1b However, they cannot be turned face up on the same turn they were set. 2.2.1c However, some Trap cards restrict when (and in response to what) they can be flipped over. If a player mistakenly flips over a trap card when the activation condition has not been met, they keep it face down and play continues as normal.
	- 2.2.1b Players can only set one card per turn.

- 2.2.2 YuGiOh 'normal' spells are considered sorcery spells. Field spells are considered enchantments. References to YuGiOh 'spells' refer to noncreature spells. References to YuGiOh 'spells' may also refer to noncreature, nonland permanents if described as 'spells on the field'.
- 2.2.3 References to 'your opponent' in YuGiOh generally refer to an opponent. References to 'both players' generally refer to all players.
	- 2.2.3a References to 'your opponent' on an ability also targeting permanent refer to that permanent's controller.

	- 2.3.0a Disney Lorcana cards that can be played into the inkwell as ink can be placed down as a land called "Ink" that produces colorless mana. This counts as playing a land for turn. (There is therefore little reason to do this.)
		- 2.3.1aa Cards becoming ink in other ways (for example, as the effect of a spell) have the same interaction, becoming lands called "Ink" that produce colorless mana.
		- 2.3.1ab Disney Lorcana cards flipped over by an effect of some other card follow the rules of that card, rather than becoming ink.
